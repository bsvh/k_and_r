**Exercise 1.5:** *Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the
interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or
normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:*

```scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y) 
  (if (= x 0) 
      0 
      y))
```

*Then he evaluates the expression*

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

*What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses
normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule
for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result
determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)*

**applicative-order:** An applicative order interpreter expands all operands
and then applies procedures to those operands. Because of this, the expression
`(test 0 (p)` will attempt to evaluate `(p)` which will never end and hence the
procedure will continuously evaluate `(p)` forever. The function will never
return a value.

**normal-order:** A normal order interpreter fully substitutes all operators
before evaluation and doesn't evaluate operands until needed.  As such, the
`(test 0 (p))` will become

```scheme
((if (= 0 0) 0 (p)))
```

at which point the condition `(= 0 0)` is true and 0 is returned.
