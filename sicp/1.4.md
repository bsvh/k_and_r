**Exercise 1.4:** *Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations
whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the
behavior of the following procedure:*

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

---

The above code checks the argument `b` and determines if it is a positive number.
If it is, the `+` operator is used on arguments `a` and `b` to add them together.
If `b` is less than 0, then the `-` operator is used to subtract `b` from `a`,
which is equivalent to adding `a` and the absolute value of `b`.
